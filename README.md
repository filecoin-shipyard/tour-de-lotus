# Tour de Lotus

A slideshow built with [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) and
[mdx-deck-live-code](https://github.com/JReinhold/mdx-deck-live-code)
that connects to a real or simulated [Lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus)
"local net" and uses [Lotus JS Client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client)
to perform various API actions.

**Work in Progress**

We're using this to:

* give a quick overview of Lotus / Filecoin and the API
* provide a series of starter examples
* test the Lotus JS Client
* test Lotus itself
* prototype tests that will land in [js-lotus-client-testground](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-testground)
