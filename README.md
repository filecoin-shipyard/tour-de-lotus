# Tour de Lotus

## Status

This repository is in a **frozen** state. It is not being maintained or kept in sync with the libraries it depends on. Even though this work on this repository has been **shelved**, anyone interested in updating or maintaining this library should express their interest on one Filecoin community conversation mediums: <https://github.com/filecoin-project/community#join-the-community>.

A slideshow built with [mdx-deck](https://github.com/jxnblk/mdx-deck) and
[mdx-deck-live-code](https://github.com/JReinhold/mdx-deck-live-code)
that connects to a real or simulated [Lotus](https://github.com/filecoin-project/lotus)
"local net" and uses [Lotus JS Client](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client)
to perform various API actions.

**Work in Progress**

We're using this to:

* give a quick overview of Lotus / Filecoin and the API
* provide a series of starter examples
* test the Lotus JS Client
* test Lotus itself
* prototype tests that will land in [js-lotus-client-testground](https://github.com/filecoin-shipyard/js-lotus-client-testground)
